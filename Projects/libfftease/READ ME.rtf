\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is the library required to compile all members of FFTease. This library was developed by Eric Lyon and Chris Penrose based in part on the C phase vocoder presented by F. Richard Moore in "Elements of Computer Music."\
\
This version has been updated to utilize Max memory functions.\
\
Note that this library need not be built for Mac applications, since the files are directly included in each Xcode project.\
